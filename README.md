# [EduCamps Website](http://educamps.us/)

EduCamps website created using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, jQuery, AJAX, and MySQL.

Comprehensive website with both client-side and server-side processing.

How to view this website:
1) http://educamps.us (This is an AWS hosted version of our website that is connected to our database) 
This is the most functional version of this project.

2) http://students.engr.scu.edu/~skaliyur/COEN161Project/index.php (This version is hosted on Santa Clara Universityâ€™s engineering servers)
Database functionality is not implemented here so numerous features of the site will not work.
